                          * TPM2.0 Linux enabling *
                          Quan Xu <quan.xu@intel.com>
Introduction:
	Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, 
which is a dedicated microprocessor designed to secure hardware by integrating cryptographic 
keys into device [1]. TPM 2.0 is used in this document to refer to the next version of the 
Trusted Computing Group TPM specification. This patch is enabling for Linux to communicate with 
TPM 2.0 hardware or TPM 2.0 simulator. 

[Kernel Interfaces]:
I define 6 new kernel interfaces in /sys/class/misc/tpm0/device, Such as endorseauth, ownerauth, 
pcrs, phenable, shenable, ehenable.

*endorseauth:
0: endorsementAuth has not been changed since TPM2_Clear().
1: TPM2_HierarchyChangeAuth() with endorsementAuth has been executed since the last TPM2_Clear().

*ownerauth:
1: TPM2_HierarchyChangeAuth() with ownerAuth has been executed since the last TPM2_Clear().
0: ownerAuth has not been changed since TPM2_Clear().

*pcrs:
All digest values of PCR with sha1 algorithm.

*phenable:
1: The platform hierarchy is enabled and platformAuth or platformPolicy may be used for authorization.
0: platformAuth and platformPolicy may not be used for authorizations, and objects in the platform 
   hierarchy, including NV Indexes and persistent objects, cannot be used.

*shenable:
1: The Storage hierarchy is enabled and ownerAuth or ownerPolicy may be used for authorization.
0: ownerAuth and ownerPolicy may not be used for authorizations, and objects in the Storage hierarchy,
   including NV Indexes and persistent objects, cannot be used. 

*ehenable:
1:  The EPS hierarchy is enabled and endorsementAuth may be used to authorize commands.
0:  endorsementAuth and endorsementPolicy may not be used for authorizations, and objects in the 
    endorsement hierarchy, including persistent objects, cannot be used.

[Patch enabling]:
This patch is based on Linux 3.9.1. Configure the patched Linux kernel source code with following 
setup steps and modprobe tpm2_tis.
